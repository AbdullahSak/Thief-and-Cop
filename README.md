# Thief-and-Cop
Basic game in C

This is a game where you play as a thief -marked as "T"- and your goal is to reach exit -marked as "E"- without getting caught by police -marked as "P"- or going through walls -marked as "W".
The map is created on the console. No fancy GUI.
There are two difficulty settings. Easy and hard. In easy mode, police is moving randomly but in hard mode police is trying to reach you. Police is using "Manhattan Distance" in order to find the shortest possible direction to catch you.
This was a term project for my introduction course. Feel free to use this code, ask anything or give any feedback.
